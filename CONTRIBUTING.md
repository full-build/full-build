# Before you file a bug...

* Did you [read the documentation](https://github.com/pchalamet/full-build/wiki)?
* Did you search the issues list to see if someone already reported it?
* Did you create a simple repro for the problem?

# Before you submit a PR...

* Did you ensure this is an [accepted up-for-grabs issue]? (If not, open one to start the discussion)
* Does the code follow existing coding styles? (spaces, comments, no regions, etc.)?
* Did you write unit tests?
* Did you pass integration tests?
